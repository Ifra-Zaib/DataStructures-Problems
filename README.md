# Data Structures and Algorithms
---
##### In this repository, I have compiled all the concepts of data structures that I have learned throughout my semester. This includes fundamental concepts such as:

#### Abstract Data Types (ADT)
#### Linked Lists
+ Singly Linked List
+ Doubly Linked List
+ Circular Linked List
#### Queues (FIFO)
+ Input Restricted Queues
#### Stacks (LIFO)
#### Trees
+ Binary Search Trees (BST)
+ AVL Trees
#### Hashing
+ Linear Hashing
+ Quadratic Probing
+ Double Hashing
#### Graphs
+ Breadth-First Search (BFS)
+ Depth-First Search (DFS)
##### All data structures handled with pointers except Simple Array. Some Data structure implemented with different variations.
